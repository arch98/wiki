User Story 1 :Ability to see weather in their location.

User Story 2: Different icon/background depending on the weather

User Story 3: Use of a button to toggle between Celsius and Farenhiet.

The app displays:

1) temperature
2) location
3) description of weather
4) an icon or background image depicting the weather.
